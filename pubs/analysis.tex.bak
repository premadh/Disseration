%%          Multiresolution stuff  %%%%%%%%%%%
Measurement of physical phenomenon such as distance, weight, and time
started since the time immemorial and has been cornerstone of our 
knowledge and learning~\cite{klein2012science}. Measurement has also
become integral part of our everyday life. The inventions 
and discoveries of the modern world would cease to exist in absence of 
measurement technology. The measurement technology has also continuously 
improved over the years. Result of a measurement process is generation 
of the data. 

The older generation technology measures only the coarse unit of the 
phenomenon generating data in coarse resolution. In contrast, the newer 
generation technology measures the finer units of the phenomenon  
producing the data in fine resolution~\cite{Garland99,measureimprove}. 
Resolution here defines the amount of information in each data sample, 
i.e., the level of detail. Multiresolution data is generated by 
measuring the same phenomenon  in different levels of 
detail~\cite{barth2002multiscale,Garland99,willsky02}. 
Thus, the multiresolution data describes the same phenomenon in 
different data representation. One of the simplest illustration 
of multi\-resolution data can is in the measurement of temperature. 
We can measure temperature in fine units of time such as hour, 
and day producing data at a fine resolution. In contrast, 
we can also measure temperature in coarse units of time 
such as month, and year producing data in coarse resolution.

real world scenario. The figure shows the geographical division as 
the part of heirarchy which when measured results in multiresolution 
data.} 
\label{Fig:oncology}
\end{figure}

Multiresolution data often forms a part-of-hierarchy as shown 
in Figure~\ref{Fig:oncology}. For example, the world is a collection
of different continents such as Asia, Europe, and Africa. 
This generates coarser view of data. Similarly, the world is also a 
collection of different countries such as 
Singapore, Finland, and Sweden. Furthermore, these countries 
can be divided into municipalities, and the municipalities into 
streets, and the streets into blocks. This hierarchical 
forms a multiresolution data which represents a part-of-hierarchy.

\section{Chromosomal Aberrations in Cancer}
\label{s:cancer}

Cancer is a heterogeneous collection of diseases characterized 
by abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells; their ability to 
migrate to other parts of human body and destroy neighboring cells
and tissues~\cite{bishop99}. Cancer rates have been increasing rapidly. 
Recent World Health Organization (WHO) report on cancer showed that 
number of cancer patients escalated to 14.1 million in 2012 and  
cancer was responsible for 8.2 million deaths~\cite{who2014}. The 
menace of cancer is increasing and WHO estimate shows that cancer 
will  rise 57\% worldwide in the next 20 years signaling an imminent
human disaster. The cost of cancer is also increasing rapidly. In 2010, 
estimate of the global cost of cancer reached approximately 963 billion 
euros~\cite{who2014}. The amount is more than nine times the total 
budgeted expenditure of Finland. 

A wide range of genetic mutations and molecular mechanisms known 
as chromosomal aberrations are identified as the hallmarks
of  disorders such as Cancer, Schizophrenia, and 
infertility~\cite{vogelstein2002}. In cancer research, 
identification and characterization of chromosomal aberrations 
are crucial to study and understand pathogenesis of cancer. 
Furthermore, study of chromosomal aberrations provides necessary 
information to select the optimal target for cancer therapy on 
individual level~\cite{kirsch1993causes}. Study of chromosomal 
aberrations also has clinical applications such as 
studying multiple congenital abnormalities and identifying
the family history of Down syndrome~\cite{obe2007chromosomal}. 
Copy number variations (CNVs) are structural variation in genome
such that a region on the genome will have different copies of 
DNA~\cite{stankiewicz2010}. In human, normal copy number is two,
each child inherits one from each parent. Deletion or loss is 
the condition when the copy number is less than two. Duplication or
gain is the condition when the copy number is more than two. Similarly, 
amplification is the condition when the copy number increases more 
than 5.

Different measurement methods have been proposed to measure ge\-nome.
Banding technology such as Giemsa banding (G--banding) was 
produces a visible karyotype by staining the 
chromosomes~\cite{benn1992}. Similarly, microarray technology such 
as the  Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH)~\cite{kallioniemi92} 
and Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH)~\cite{pinkel98}
facilities the study of Copy Number Variations (CNV) without the 
need for culturing cells. Additionally, 
Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) are used to sequence the 
genomes of organisms. Similarly, Oligonucleotide arrays uses oligos 
of short lengths (less than 25 bases) instead of the 
targets~\cite{lockhart96}. Furthermore, promoter array probes
thousands of promoter sequences in one array experiment~\cite{wang2005}.
The Next Generation Sequencing Methods provide high throughput 
and high resolution techniques to explore and answer genome-wide 
biological questions~\cite{mardis08}.

Studying the generated data produces wide range of 
benefits. Therefore, computational methods have been used 
to understand the generated data. The phenomenon of doubling of 
number of transistors in a chip in 18 to 24 months, often known as 
Moore's Law~\cite{moore1965}, has improved the processing power of 
computers exponentially. Similarly, with the advent of Internet, 
communication systems have also improved dramatically. The
the data storage capacity are also rapidly rising. These 
improvements have resulted in  data in large numbers thus
necessitating novel algorithms to analyze the generated data.


\section{Multiresolution Chromosomal Amplification Data}
\label{s:multchrdata}

Years of evolution and adaptation have made organisms  
complex biological being~\cite{mcshea1991}. Ever improving 
measurement technology have also provided the facilities to 
measure the complex phenomenon in biology~\cite{united2009new}. 
Multiresolution data are also resoundingly present in biology.
To put in perspective, older generation technology such as the 
banding measures a karyotype producing data of dimensionality 
of hundreds~\cite{benn1992,shaffer05}. In contrast,  
newer generation technology such as micro-array measures the 
same karyotype generating the data of dimensionality of 
thousands~\cite{kallioniemi92,pinkel98}. Additionally, latest 
technology known as Next Generation Sequencing produces the 
data with millions of dimensions~\cite{mardis08,roh10com}.

Similar methods also produce data in different resolutions because 
of improvements within the methods such as microarrays and banding. 
For example, aCGH 
improves the mapping resolution of 20Mbp (Megabase Pairs) to 100 
Kbp (Kilobase Pairs) over its predecessors. Similarly, in banding 
International System for human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) has
defined five different resolutions of the chromosome namely: 300, 
400, 550, 700, 850~\cite{shaffer05}. Each resolution defines the 
precision of division of karyotype. In these five resolutions, 
resolution 300 divides the karyotype with least precision 
whereas resolution 850 divides the karyotype with increasing
precision. In resolution 300, a karyotype is divided into 
312 ($\approx 300$) different regions whereas in resolution 850, 
a karyotype is divided into 862 ($\approx 850$) different regions.
In addition to the data in different resolution efforts have 
been made to study different cancer types collecting data from 
different sources in pan--cancer  initiative~\cite{pancancer}. 
The aim of the study is to develop an integrated picture of
commonalities, differences, and emergent  themes across tumor 
lineages. The initiative involves  multiple datasets and 
multiple cancers thus showing multiresolution methods in
pan--cancer initiative.

\label{Fig:chr21}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Figure~\ref{Fig:chr21} shows five different resolutions in 
chromosome 21 according in G-banding framework according to 
the ISCN standard. Chromosome 21 is
divided into 8, 8, 10, 12, and 14 regions in resolution
300, 400, 550, 700, and 850. The naming of the regions 
and their division in different resolutions is irregular 
and hierarchical~\cite{shaffer05}. Some regions are  
undivided whereas some other regions are divided into  
different regions. For example, the regions 21p12 and 
21p13 are undivided in all the resolutions where as the 
region 21q22 is  divided into 3 and 5 different regions 
in resolution  550 and 850. This division of karyotype
in different levels of detail generates data in multiple
resolutions.

\label{Fig:datamulti}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Two different datasets were available in coarse resolution and 
fine resolution. Researchers at the University of Helsinki 
compiled a dataset of chromosomal amplification in coarse 
resolution reading through the literature published 
between 1992--2002~\cite{knuutila2000}. 
All the 838 journal articles were read through manually.
The data describes the chromosomal amplification patterns of 
4590 cancer patients in coarse resolution, i.e., resolution 
400 where a karyotype is divided into 393 different regions.
Similarly, data in fine resolution extracted 
from~\cite{baudis07,progenetix} describes chromosomal
amplification in fine resolution, i.e., resolution 850 where a 
karyotype is divided into 862 different regions.

In the Figure~\ref{Fig:datamulti}, rows denotes the cancer patients 
and the spatial co-ordinates on the X-axis denotes the chromosomal 
region. The value of one (1) denotes amplification and zero (0) 
denotes the absence of amplification in that specific region of 
genome for that specific cancer patient. In the figure, white color 
denotes the absence of amplification in the chromosomal region, and 
black color presence of amplification in the chromosomal region. 

In coarse resolution, the left panel part of the  Figure~\ref{Fig:datamulti}
shows one region 21p21 is divided into 3 regions in fine resolution  
21p21.1, 21p21.2, and 21p21.3 in the right panel of the figure.
In contrast, some of the regions such as 21p13 and 21p12 are the 
same in both coarse and fine resolution. Therefore, different regions 
are divided differently, some regions are undivided while other
regions are divided into varying number of regions. Nevertheless, 
the division is consistent because of the ISCN standard. Detailed 
description of the amplification dataset can be found 
in~\cite{myllykangas06}.

\section{Ontology of Multiresolution Data}
\label{s:ontologymulti}

The concept of ontology transcends back to the dates of noble 
philosophers Aristotle, Parmenides, and Jacob Lorhard who 
used the term ontology in the philosophical context to
describe the state of being, and reality~\cite{cohen2014}.
Recently, the term ontology has found its prominence 
in the computer and information science community. 
In computer science community, ontology is 
the mechanism for explicit description of the 
conceptualization of the knowledge represented in the 
knowledge base~\cite{gruber1993,swartout1996}. 

Ontology is popularly used to describe the semantics of the 
data in machine learning and data mining community~\cite{panov2012}. 
%In addition to the data in multiple resolutions, 
Relevant additional knowledge used in conjuction with multiresolution data
will enhance the knowledge discovery process. 
Expansion of semantic web and increasing availability 
domain knowledge as ontologies results in  
growth of semantic data. Semantic data mining algorithms
addresses the challenge of mining abundance of knowledge 
encoded in domain ontologies constrained by the heuristics 
computed from the empirical data~\cite{Vavpetic13jiis}. 

Multiresolution data conceptualizes one of the essential 
ontological dichotomies of universals and particulars
in metaphysics~\cite{russell1911,so49866}. The data
in the coarse resolution can be conceptualized as 
universals whereas data in fine resolution can be 
conceptualized as the particulars. Therefore, we 
can use ontological information in modelling 
multiresolution data as in~\citepub{c3} and \citepub{j2}.

Biological systems are complex and interwoven subsystems effect 
the functionalities of each other~\cite{kim2003}. Therefore, 
chromosomal amplifications can effect, and be effected by 
other biological phenomenon. Furthermore, 
cancer is a multi-factorial disease and heterogeneity of 
cancer also suggests that different biological phenomenon in 
addition to chromosomal aberration can be responsible
for cancer. Therefore, we use additional background
knowledge to enhance the comprehensive analysis of chromosomal
amplification datasets to understand the phenomenon of cancer.
The additional knowledge used in the analysis are the cancer genes, 
virus integration sites, fragile sites, and ampli\-fication 
hotspots. 

Causes of cancer are the mutations in genes to a larger extent by
``acquired mutation'' and to a lesser extent by ``germline
mutation''~\cite{futreal2004}. Authors in~\cite{futreal2004},
have listed the cancer genes and compared them to the complete
gene set revealed by the human genome sequence. Similarly,
fragile sites are non-randomly distributed loci on human 
chromosome that show a constriction or a gap and 
increased frequency of chromosome breakage under conditions 
of partial replication stress~\cite{durkin07,schwartz06}.
The fragile sites are often found rearranged in 
cancers~\cite{glover2005}. Virus integration sites 
are the locations in chromosome where the viral 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inserts into host cell 
DNA~\cite{khoury2013}. Virus are responsible for approximately 
12\% of cancers~\cite{khoury2013,zurHausen2009}.
Amplification hotspots are frequently amplified chromosomal 
locations identified using computational modeling 
in~\cite{myllykangas06}. The semantic data mining methods 
uses these additional knowledge  to enhance the knowledge
discovery process~\citepub{j2}.

\section{Related Work in Multiresolution Data Analysis}
\label{s:relatedMultiRes}

Multiresolution data research community is growing steadily because 
of the pragmatic approach of dealing with datasets in different 
representation within a single analysis and also because of the 
increasing multiresolution data production in different application
areas~\cite{barth2002multiscale,he2000wavelet,iske2004}. 
Authors in~\cite{reddy2007} have used multiresolution strategy to 
improve the efficiency of boosting algorithms in regression and 
classification taking model-driven and data-driven multiresolution
strategy. Similarly, multi\-resolution trees have been used for object
recognition in homogeneous data based on recursive neural 
networks~\cite{bianchini2006}.
Multiresolution visualizations have been used to visualize the 
large volume of complex data using semantic analysis to 
infer increasing levels of meaning from the data~\cite{hussain11}.


\subsection{Multiresolution Probabilistic Models}
\label{s:multiresProMdl}

Multiresolution modelling has also received research interest in 
probabilistic modelling domain. Most of the focus in this thesis
has been the use of probabilistic models, namely mixture models,
in modelling multiresolution  data. Traditional machine learning 
and data mining methods are unable to handle  multiresolution 
data in thier standarad form because  of the difference in 
representations of data in different  resolutions.. Similarly, 
mixture models are  unable to model multi\-resolution data in 
their standard form. The only approach to model multiresolution data is 
to model each resolution differently and at best compare the results.
Nevertheless, multiresolution models have found their usage in the 
literature, especially, in the image processing domain. 
Multi\-resolution kd--trees have been used to improve the performance 
of mixture models reducing the cost associated with Expectation 
Maximization (EM) algorithm~\cite{moore99veryfast}. Similarly,
multiresolution kd--trees have been used to build robust models
against the outliers using the EM algorithm~\cite{ng03robust}. 
Similarly, multiresolution binary trees have been used to store
probability values  efficiently both timewise and
memorywise~\cite{bellot2003}.

Authors in~\cite{mukherjee13} improved
the performance of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) using wavelet subbands
with an additional feature of incorporating variable number of
components in the GMM\\@. The GMM in~\cite{mukherjee13} can use any 
multiresolution based decomposition for background suppression.
Authors in~\cite{wilson00} show that multiresolution Gaussian mixture 
model (MGMM) adapt to smooth motions and apply MGMM to estimate the 
visual motion.


\subsection{Related Areas}
\label{s:relatedAreas}

Multiresolution analysis shares commonality with other
research areas and applications. The following sections briefly
reviews the work on multiresolution modelling in the relevant 
research areas.

\subsubsection{Scale Space Theory and Multiscale Analysis}
\label{ss:scalespace}

Multiresolution modeling is often used synonymously with the  
scale space theory~\cite{Lindeberg94b} and also multiscale
analysis~\cite{e2011principles}. Scale--space representation 
is an improvement over multi-scale representation having an 
ability to compute representation at a desired scale and 
providing functionalities to address the challanges of
image representation at different resolutions.
In image processing domain, pyramid structures generated 
after successive smoothing, and subsampling producing a 
multiscale representation~\cite{Lindeberg94b}. Similarly, 
in scale-space theory a scale parameter, $t$, 
handles images at different scales. Generally, both 
multiscale and scale-space are methods work in model 
domain. This is also true for scale-space method because 
the smoothing parameter $t$ smooths-out the 
image structures smaller than the size $\sqrt{t}$.
However, multiresolution methods developed in this thesis
are the result of multiresolution challanges arising in 
the data domain.


\subsubsection{Wavelets}
\label{ss:wavelets}

Wavelets are appropriate methods to describe mathematical 
phenomenon such as functions and signals at different levels 
of resolution~\cite{mallat89}. Wavelet analysis have been 
popular tool in multiresolution analysis~\cite{jawerth94}.
However, the classical wavelets based techniques are useful 
in regular, consistent, and  homogeneous setting and cannot
directly handle the irrigularities in the chromosomal amplification
data discussed in Section~\ref{s:multchrdata}.


\subsubsection{Learning from Multiple Sources}
\label{ss:lfms}

Multiresolution modeling domain has a close affinity with the 
domain of learning from multiple sources~\cite{crammer08}. 
Improvement in measurement technology also increases the 
dimensionality of the data and in practical applications, 
the sample size of data is small ($N \ll d$), where $N$ represents
the number of data samples and $d$ represents data dimensionality.
Similar to multi\-resolution modeling, learning from multiple
sources aims to ameliorate the problem of curse of dimensionality, 
or Hughes effect by exploiting any related additional datasets 
such as earlier measurement experiments~\cite{crammer08}. 
Unlike multi\-resolution modeling, the additional datasets 
may only be weakly related to the analyzed dataset. The 
paradigm of learning from multiple sources is extended 
to the paradigms of multi--view~\cite{sun13multiview}, 
multi--way~\cite{huopaniemi12,huopaniemi10ismb}, and 
multi--task learning~\cite{caruna97,huopaniemi12}.

\subsubsection{Data Fusion}
\label{ss:dataFusion}

The domain of data fusion shares a common ground with the domain of 
multiresolution modeling. The domain of data fusion integrates 
multiple data and knowledge depicting the same real\-world phenomenon
in a logical, precise, and useful knowl\-edge base~\cite{goodman97math}.
Data fusion techniques are 
often used to combine data from multiple sensors such that the 
inference from the combined data is better than individual sensors.
Data integration approaches have been widely used in bioinformatics 
domain. For example, authors in~\cite{gopal2005} have proposed 
integrated database and software system that enables retrieval and 
visualization of biological relationships across heterogeneous data 
sources. Similarly, authors in~\cite{kettunen2003b} combined data 
from complementary Deoxyribonucleic Acid (cDNA) arrays and tumour 
tissue microarrays (TMA) to study the 
molecular changes in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MM). The study shows
that novel proteins associated with cell adhesion  are expressed 
either directly or as a regulatory mechanism in MM\\@.
The process of data fusion takes place at the different stages of 
analysis but it is a common practice to merge the data at the earliest stage of analysis 
in a single resolution. Nevertheless, Data fusion techniques have 
also been used to multiresolution data, especially in 
remote sensing~\cite{carter1998analysis}.

\subsubsection{Granular Computing}
\label{ss:granular}

Granular computing (GrC) also has roots in multi\-resolution 
modeling~\cite{bargiela2003granular}. GrC is a 
multidisciplinary field of study comprising of the\-ories, 
methodologies, and tools to analyze the data using the 
granules in data~\cite{Yao02agranular}. 
Granular computing aims to divide data into 
different intrinsic resolutions to solve a problem thus 
exhibiting similarity with multi\-res\-o\-lu\-tion
modeling framework. 


%Similarly, wavelets analysis have been popular tool in 
%multiresolution analysis~\cite{jawerth94}. 

%form, thereby sharing a common ground with 
%the domain of multi\-resolution modeling. 

%% Explanation of data
%who happen to be our  collaborators 
%Without the  use of fancy text mining techniques. 

%For example, 
%in bioinformatics, older generation technology such as the 
%banding measures a karyotype and produces data of 
%dimensionality of hundreds. In contrast, 
%relatively newer generation technology such as micro-array 
%measures the same karyotype and generates the data of 
%dimensionality of thousands. Additionally, latest technology 
%known as Next Generation Sequencing produces the data with 
%millions of dimensions~\cite{roh10com}.

%Both the scale-space representation and the multi\-scale analysis works 
%in the model 
%domain where models represent single resolution data at 
%different scales. %utilizing them to produce better results. 
%~\cite{lindeberg94b}

% In contrast, multi\-resolution modeling problem arises in the data domain 
% where the same data generating system is measured in varying levels of detail. 
% Most methods in machine learning and data mining literature are 
% designed to work with single resolution data. Since, the dimensionality
% of different data resolutions is different, the usual approach is
% to model each resolution separately. Scale-space methods and wavelets
% usually use a multi\-resolution analysis setting for the datasets in the 
% same resolution. Furthermore, the multi\-resolution scenarios where 
% wavelets and scale space methods have their usage require regular, consistent, 
% and homogeneous division of regions such as the pyramid structure in image 
% processing domain~\cite{wilson00}.

%Older generation technology measures the coarser units of the 
%phenomenon and generates data in coarse resolution. In contrast,
%newer generation technology measures finer units of the phenomenon
%and generates data in coarse resolution.

%Such part of hierarchy form the multiresolution data.
